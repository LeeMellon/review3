HAL Boop!

A slightly SciFi version of Fizz/Buzz

By Ian Goodrich

A web app that takes in a number from the user and checks them against the following criteria.

      Behavior                   Input                  Output
  X / 3 = “Sorry Dave”              30              “I’m sorry Dave”

  X contains 1 = “BOOP!”            10                 "BOOP!"

  X contains 0 = “BEEP!”            20                  “BEEP!”


Setup/Installation Requirements

Open in any web browser.

Known Bugs

At current time can only enter numbers up to approximately 33. Need to figure out how to implement clearing out of div to make more room.
Also not sure how to refresh so user can try again in same session. Would LOVE help/guidance on this.
